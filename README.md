# Diablo 2 meets Dungeon Keeper

These are two of my favourite games ever.
Years ago, I thought to myself I'd make a crossover game that'd be a sort of Dungeon Keeper-like game, with the lore and style of Diablo 2.

## Why?

A tribute of course!
Diablo 2 team made pretty awesome things when developping the game: 3d models rendered as sprites, random tiled-map generations and so on.
Since the assets are all over the internet I wanted to explore that myself to enjoy the lore and universe some more.

## Features

- Move  your shaman around (click)
- Dig: queue sandstone digging by clicking on the blocks. 

## Installation

- It's just static. Just run it over a server.
- Warning: pure vanilla old stuff ðŸ˜…

## Project Status

WIP and on hold.
I've switched projects since then. Scope was much too big, didn't plan anything with any game design doc or goal so I sort of drowned and switched -- as usual with unplanned work.
Learn a ton there.
